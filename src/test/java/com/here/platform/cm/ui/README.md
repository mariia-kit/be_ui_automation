## Automated tests for Consent Manager UI

All tests are based on User flows: [CM User Flows confluence page](https://confluence.in.here.com/display/OLP/Consent+Management+User+Flows)

Possible to run locally via Docker and in a local browser (Chrome prefered)

TBD for UI tests:
- Run UI tests in 2 browsers [Chrome, Firefox] or based on requirements from Product owner
- Automate UI tests via Cypress in [olp-consent](https://main.gitlab.in.here.com/consent-management/olp-consent) repository to run on each commit or to run locally on a developer's laptop to check base functionality of the pages
